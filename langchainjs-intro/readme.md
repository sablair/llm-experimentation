## Nothing to see here! Move along!

My own refresher on langchain and ollama.

If you want run the code it's a simple:

> node index.js

Test the current endpoins using your browser or favorite API tool (hello Postman!) like so:

> http://localhost:3000/compliment

or

> http://localhost:3000/translate?sentence=hello&input=english&output=spanish

or

> http://localhost:3000/math?problem=What is the product of 10 and 5? # This last one does not give a result, but shows that at least it's parsing the proble correctly
